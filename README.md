# Quizz-Louise-CDOF2
The player answers a number of questions to try and win the game.(practical work 1 of decentralization technologies)
My project is to make a quizz of general culture with juste one answer but few choices like "Who wants to be a millionaire ?"
To run the project you just need to clone the project on your machine and run it on visual studio code the implementation of the quizz is located on the quizz.py, so you need python version 3.11.

# How to play
Run the command python quizz.py.
Before answering questions, you have to choose a language.
Then you have to choose a category of questions.
You can type the number of the answer then you can see if it's correct or not and if it's not you see the correct answer.
At the end, you have your score.
Be careful, you have a timer of 15s to answer each question!

# New feature
To improve that i want to have an option to choose a langage for instance english, french or spanish.
I also want to add more question on the quizz and to choose some categorie for instance history, geography, sports...

The first feature was implemented.
The second one is not yet implemented.
